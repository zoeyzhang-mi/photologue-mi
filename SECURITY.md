# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please note that in the case of a security issue being reported, only the latest release will be fixed. Users of earlier releases of Photologue can of course patch the version that they use and open an MR - it will be reviewed and a micro-release published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities via the contact form at the personal website of the main project contributor: https://arbee.design/en-gb/contact/
